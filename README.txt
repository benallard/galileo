Introduction
------------

Galileo is a Python utility to securely synchronize a Fitbit device with the
Fitbit web service. It allows you to browse your data on their website, and
compatible applications.

All Bluetooth-based trackers are supported. Those are:

- Fitbit One
- Fitbit Zip
- Fitbit Flex
- Fitbit Force

.. note:: The Fitbit Ultra tracker is **not supported** as it communicates
          using the ANT protocol. To synchronize it, please use libfitbit_.

This utility is mainly targeted at Linux because Fitbit does not
provide any Linux-compatible software, but as Python is
cross-platform and the libraries used are available on a broad variety
of platforms, it should not be too difficult to port it to other
platforms.

Main features
-------------

- Synchronize your fitbit tracker with the fitbit server using the provided
  dongle.
- Securely communicate (using HTTPS) with the fitbit server.
- Save all your dumps locally for possible later analyse.

Installation
------------

The easy way
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: If you want to run the utility as a non-root user, you will have
             to install the udev rules manually (See `The more complicated
             way`_, or follow the instructions given when it fails).

::

    $ pip install galileo
    $ galileo

.. note:: If you don't want to install this utility system-wide, you
          may want to install it inside a virtualenv_, the behaviour
          will not be affected.

.. _virtualenv: http://www.virtualenv.org

Distribution packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following Linux distributions have packages available for installation:

**Gentoo**:
  The utility is packaged as ``app-misc/galileo`` within the
  `squeezebox <http://git.overlays.gentoo.org/gitweb/?p=user/squeezebox.git>`_
  overlay. See https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman for details of how
  to use Gentoo overlays.

The more complicated way
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you need to clone this repository locally, and install the required
dependencies:

**pyusb**:
  Need at least a 1.0 version, 0.4 and earlier are not compatible.
  Please use a tagged release as development version might contains bug or
  interface breakage.
**requests**:
  Newer versions (2.x) preferred, although older should also work.

You should copy the file ``99-fitbit.rules`` to the directory
``/etc/udev/rules.d`` in order to be able to run the utility as a
non-root user.

Don't forget to:

- restart the udev service: ``sudo service udev restart``
- unplug and re-insert the dongle to activate the new rule.

Then simply run the ``run`` script located at the root of this repository.

If your system uses systemd then there is an example unit file in the
``contrib`` directory that you may wish to customize.

Documentation
-------------

For the moment, this README (and the ``--help`` command line option) is the
main documentation we have. The wiki_ is meant to gather technical
information about the project like the communication protocol, or the format
of the dump. Once this information reached a suffficient level of maturation,
the goal is to integrate it into the project documentation. So head-on there,
and start sharing your findings !

Manual pages for the galileo(1) utility and the galileorc(5)
configuration file are provided within the ``doc`` directory.
