.SH DESCRIPTION
Synchronize Fitbit wearable fitness tracker devices with the Fitbit web service.
Visit <
.B https://www.fitbit.com
>, or use a Fitbit-compatible app in order
to browse your data.

.SH MODES
.TP
.B sync
Perform the synchronization of all found trackers, then exit. This is
the default mode if none is specified.
.TP
.B daemon
Periodically perform synchronization of all found trackers.
.B galileo
will periodically perform synchronization until the daemon is killed. The
period can be controlled via the
.B \-\-daemon\-period
option.
.TP
.B version
Display the
.B galileo
version and exit.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
show command-line usage and exit.
.TP
.BR "\-c \fIRCCONFIGNAME\fR" ", " "\-\-config \fIRCCONFIGNAME\fR"
use \fIRCCONFIGNAME\fR as extra configuration file in order to allow overriding
of settings.

.P
The remaining options are first read from configuration file, and can be
overridden by using command line switches. For this reason, positive and
negative versions are available (\fB\-\-foo\fR and \fB\-\-no\-foo\fR). Please
see
.BR galileorc (5)
for more information about the configuration files.

.SS Logging options:
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
display general information on progress during synchronization.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-debug
as \fB\-\-verbose\fR, but also shows internal activity useful for
diagnosing problems.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
show no output except for errors and a summary. This is the default
if no other logging options are specified.
.SS Synchronization control options:
.TP
\fB\-I\fR \fIID\fR [\fIID\fR ...], \
\fB\-\-include\fR \fIID\fR [\fIID\fR ...]
list of tracker IDs to synchronize (if not set, all found trackers are
synchronized).
.TP
\fB\-X\fR \fIID\fR [\fIID\fR ...], \
\fB\-\-exclude\fR \fIID\fR [\fIID\fR ...]
list of tracker IDs to avoid synchronizing (no trackers are excluded
by default).
.TP
.B \-\-force
a tracker will not be synchronized with the Fitbit web service if it reports
that it was recently synchronized. This option overrides that behavior.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-force
if the configuration file includes the \fBforce\-sync\fR option to
always force synchronization, this option will restore the default
behaviour.
.TP
.BI \-\-daemon\-period " PERIOD"
set the time to wait between synchronizations when running in
\fBdaemon\fR mode. The period is specified in milliseconds and
defaults to 15000 (15 seconds).
.SS Tracker data saving options:
.TP
.B \-\-dump
save a copy of the tracker data. Tracker data is stored under a
tracker-specific subdirectory of a directory that is set using the
\fB\-\-dump\-dir\fR option. This is the default behavior.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-dump
disables the saving of tracker data.
.TP
.BI \-\-dump\-dir " DIR"
the directory used to store the tracker dumps (defaults to
\fB~/.galileo\fR).
.SS Data transfer options:
.TP
.B \-\-upload
synchronize tracker data with the Fitbit web service. This is the
default.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-upload
prevent the uploading of tracker data to the Fitbit web service. Data
is not deleted from trackers until it is acknowledged by the fitbit server
 so this will not result in data loss.
.TP
.B \-\-https\-only
data sent to the Fitbit web service will be transferred via a secure connection
using HTTPS. This is the default.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-https\-only
if HTTPS connection is not possible, this will allow the fallback to HTTP.
This should only be required if problems with encryption libraries prevent
data transfer without this option.

.SH REQUIREMENTS
An original Fitbit Bluetooth-LE USB synchronization dongle is
required.
.PP
The Fitbit tracker must already be registered to your Fitbit account
(see the BUGS section).
.SH FILES
.TP
.IR /etc/galileo/config ", " $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/galileo/config ", " ~/.galileorc
The configuration files used for default settings. See
.BR galileorc (5)
for further details about those files

.SH BUGS
.B galileo
doesn't currently support linking (pairing) trackers with the Fitbit
web service account. Before a new tracker can be synchronized it must
first be linked to your Fitbit account using another method such as a
Fitbit mobile or tablet app, or the official Fitbit Windows or
Macintosh desktop clients.
.PP
There are no current facilities to make use of the data stored with
the \fB\-\-dump\fR command.
