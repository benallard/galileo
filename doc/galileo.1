.SH "NAME"
galileo \- synchronize Fitbit devices
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B galileo
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]... [\fIMODE\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Synchronize Fitbit wearable fitness tracker devices with the Fitbit web service.
Visit <\fBhttps://www.fitbit.com\fR>, or use a Fitbit-compatible app in order
to browse your data.
.SH "MODES"
.TP
\fBsync\fR
Perform the synchronization of all found trackers, then exit. This is
the default mode if none is specified.
.TP
\fBdaemon\fR
Periodically perform synchronization of all found trackers.
.B galileo
will periodically perform synchronization until the daemon is killed. The
period can be controlled via the \fB\-\-daemon\-period\fR option.
.TP
\fBversion\fR
Display the
.B galileo
version and exit.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show command-line usage and exit.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIRCCONFIGNAME\fR, \fB\-\-config\fR \fIRCCONFIGNAME\fR
use \fIRCCONFIGNAME\fR as extra configuration file in order to allow overriding
of settings.
.SS "Logging options:"
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
display general information on progress during synchronization.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
as \fB\-\-verbose\fR, but also shows internal activity useful for
diagnosing problems.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
show no output except for errors and a summary. This is the default
if no other logging options are specified.
.SS "Synchronization control options:"
.TP
\fB\-I\fR \fIID\fR [\fIID\fR ...], \
\fB\-\-include\fR \fIID\fR [\fIID\fR ...]
list of tracker IDs to synchronize (if not set, all found trackers are
synchronized).
.TP
\fB\-X\fR \fIID\fR [\fIID\fR ...], \
\fB\-\-exclude\fR \fIID\fR [\fIID\fR ...]
list of tracker IDs to avoid synchronizing (no trackers are excluded
by default).
.TP
\fB\-\-force\fR
a tracker will not be synchronized with the Fitbit web service if it reports
that it was recently synchronized. This option overrides that behavior.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-force\fR
if the configuration file includes the \fBforce\-sync\fR option to
always force synchronization, this option will restore the default
behaviour.
.TP
\fB\-\-daemon\-period\fR \fIDAEMON\-PERIOD\fR
set the time to wait between synchronizations when running in
\fBdaemon\fR mode. The period is specified in milliseconds (it
defaults to 15000 [15 seconds]).
.SS "Tracker data saving options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\fR
save a copy of the tracker data. Tracker data is stored under a
tracker-specific subdirectory of a directory that is set using the
\fB\-\-dump\-dir\fR option. This is the default behavior.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-dump\fR
disables the saving of tracker data.
.TP
\fB\-\-dump\-dir\fR \fIDUMP\-DIR\fR
the directory used to store the tracker dumps (defaults to
\fB~/.galileo\fR).
.SS "Data transfer options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-upload\fR
synchronize tracker data with the Fitbit web service. This is the
default.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-upload\fR
prevent the uploading of tracker data to the Fitbit web service. Data
is not deleted from trackers until it is acknowledged by the fitbit server
 so this will not result in data loss.
.TP
\fB\-\-https\-only\fR
data sent to the Fitbit web service will be transferred via a secure connection
using HTTPS. This is the default.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-https\-only\fR
if HTTPS connection is not possible, this will allow the fallback to HTTP.
This should only be required if problems with encryption libraries prevent
data transfer without this option.
.SH "REQUIREMENTS"
An original Fitbit Bluetooth-LE USB synchronization dongle is
required.
.PP
The Fitbit tracker must already be registered to your Fitbit account
(see the BUGS section).
.SH FILES
.I ~/.galileorc
.RS
The configuration file supplying default settings (the location of
this file can be changed with the \fB\-\-config\fR option). Settings
from this file can be overridden with command-line options. See
.BR galileorc (5)
for further details.
.RE
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.TP

.SH "AUTHOR"
Written and maintained by Beno√Æt Allard, with contributions from other
authors.
.SH "BUGS"
.B galileo
doesn't currently support linking (pairing) trackers with the Fitbit
web service account. Before a new tracker can be synchronized it must
first be linked to your Fitbit account using another method such as a
Fitbit mobile or tablet app, or the official Fitbit Windows or
Macintosh desktop clients.
.PP
There are no current facilities to make use of the data stored with
the \fB\-\-dump\fR command.
.PP
