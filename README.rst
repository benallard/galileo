Introduction
------------

This is a python script to synchronise a fitbit device with the fitbit server.

Installation
------------

First, you need to clone this repository locally, (or download the script to you local machine), and install the required dependencies:

- pyusb (tested with 1.0.0b1)
- requests (tested with 2.0.1)

You should copy the file ``50-fitbit.rules`` in the directory ``/etc/udev/rules.d`` in order to be able to run the script as a normal user. (Don't forget to replace my username with yours, and to unplug and replug the dongle for the rule to be active).

Then simply run the script.
